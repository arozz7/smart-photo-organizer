# Create & Set Builder Feature

The **Create** section is a powerful workspace designed for curating sets of photos from your library based on complex search criteria and exporting them to new albums.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Workspace
Located at `/create` (via the "Create" sidebar link), this workspace is divided into three areas:
-   **Search Panel (Left):** Where you define your filters.
-   **Results Grid (Center):** Where matching photos appear.
-   **Current Set (Right):** Your staging area for selected photos.

### 2. Advanced Search Logic
Unlike the simple global filter, the Create search offers Boolean logic:
-   **People:** Select multiple people.
    -   **Match ALL:** Finds photos containing *everyone* selected (e.g., "Alice AND Bob" in the same photo).
    -   **Match ANY (Default):** Finds photos containing *anyone* selected (e.g., "Alice OR Bob").
-   **Tags:** Works similarly to People. You can combine tags (e.g., "bearch" AND "sunset").
-   **Text Search:** Filters by semantic description or captions.

### 3. The "Set" (Staging Area)
The "Current Set" is a temporary collection.
-   **Persistence:** You can run a search, add 5 photos, change your search completely, and add 5 more. The set remembers your selection across different searches.
-   **Review:** The right-hand panel lets you verify exactly what is in your set and remove individual items before exporting.

### 4. Exporting / Creating Albums
Once you are happy with your "Set":
1.  Click **"Export Album"**.
2.  Select a destination folder on your computer.
3.  The application will **copy** (not move) the original full-resolution files to that folder.

This is perfect for creating USB drives for family members, preparing photos for printing, or organizing specific events.
